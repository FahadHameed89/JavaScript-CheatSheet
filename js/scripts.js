 *  var can be used to declare variables. This can be used anywhere in the program after it is     declared. Therefore they can easily be used in various places in the program. 
    However, if a var is declared within a function, this variable will instead only be kept inside
    the function scope
    It's considered bad practice to use var, unless you absolutely need to use it.
